      The COVID-19 outbreak is devastating restaurants. However, New York City
      temporarily is
      <a href="https://sla.ny.gov/Restrictions-in-Response-to-COVID-19"
        >allowing restaurants to sell to-go alcohol</a
      >
      alongside food. Most restaurants have thousands of dollars in prepaid

      While
      <a href="https://www.helpmainstreet.com/">buying gift cards</a> is one way

      cash upfront that they can spend without worry.
